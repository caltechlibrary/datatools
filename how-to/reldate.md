# Using reldate

If today was 2014-08-03 and you wanted the date three days in the past try–

```shell
    reldate 3 days
```

The output would be

```
    2014-08-06
```

## TIME UNITS

Supported time units are

+ day(s)
+ week(s)
+ year(s)

Specifying a date to calucate from

reldate handles dates in the YYYY-MM-DD format (e.g. March 1, 2014 would be
2014-03-01). By default reldate uses today as the date to calculate relative
time from. If you use the –from option you can it will calculate the
relative date from that specific date.

```shell
   reldate --from=2014-08-03 3 days
```

Will yield

```shell
    2014-08-06
```

## NEGATIVE INCREMENTS

Command line arguments traditionally start with a dash which we also use to
denote a nagative number. To tell the command line process that to not treat
negative numbers as an “option” precede your time increment and time unit
with a double dash.

```shell
    reldate --from=2014-08-03 -- -3 days
```

Will yield

```
    2014-07-31
```

## RELATIVE WEEK DAYS

You can calculate a date from a weekday name (e.g. Saturday, Monday, Tuesday)
knowning a day (e.g. 2015-02-10 or the current date of the week) occurring in
a week. A common case would be wanting to figure out the Monday date of a week
containing 2015-02-10. The week is presumed to start on Sunday (i.e. 0) and
finish with Saturday (e.g. 6).

```shell
    reldate --from=2015-02-10 Monday
```

will yield

```
    2015-02-09
```

As that is the Monday of the week containing 2015-02-10. Weekday names case
insensitive and can be the first three letters of the English names or full
English names (e.g. Monday, monday, Mon, mon).
