USAGE: jsonjoin [OPTIONS] JSON_FILE_1 [JSON_FILE_2 ...]

DESCRIPTION

jsonjoin is a command line tool that takes one (or more) JSON objects files
and joins them to a root JSON object read from standard input (or
file identified by -input option).  By default the resulting
joined JSON object is written to standard out.

The default behavior for jsonjoin is to create key/value pairs
based on the joined JSON document names and their contents.
This can be thought of as a branching behavior. Each additional
file becomes a branch and its key/value pairs become leafs.
The root JSON object is assumed to come from standard input
but can be designated by the -input option or created by the
-create option. Each additional file specified as a command line
argument is then treated as a new branch.

In addition to the branching behavior you can join JSON objects in a
flat manner.  The flat joining process can be ether non-destructive
adding new key/value pairs (-update option) or destructive
overwriting key/value pairs (-overwrite option).

Note: jsonjoin doesn't support a JSON array as the root JSON object.

OPTIONS

    -create             create an empty root object, {}
    -examples           display example(s)
    -generate-manpage   generate man page
    -generate-markdown  generate markdown docs
    -h, -help           display help
    -i, -input          input filename (for root object)
    -l, -license        display license
    -nl, -newline       if true add a trailing newline
    -o, -output         output filename
    -overwrite          copy all key/values into root object
    -quiet              suppress error messages
    -update             copy new key/values pairs into root object
    -v, -version        display version


EXAMPLES

Consider two JSON objects one in person.json and another
in profile.json.

person.json contains

   { "name": "Doe, Jane", "email":"jd@example.org", "age": 42 }

profile.json contains

   { "name": "Doe, Jane", "bio": "World renowned geophysist.",
     "email": "jane.doe@example.edu" }

A simple join of person.json with profile.json (note the
-create option)

   jsonjoin -create person.json profile.json

would yield and object like

   {
     "person":  { "name": "Doe, Jane", "email":"jd@example.org",
	 			"age": 42},
     "profile": { "name": "Doe, Jane", "bio": "World renowned geophysist.",
                  "email": "jane.doe@example.edu" }
   }

Likewise if you want to treat person.json as the root object and add
profile.json as a branch try

   cat person.json | jsonjoin profile.json

or

   jsonjoin -i person.json profile.json

this yields an object like

   {
     "name": "Doe, Jane", "email":"jd@example.org", "age": 42,
     "profile": { "name": "Doe, Jane", "bio": "World renowned geophysist.",
                  "email": "jane.doe@example.edu" }
   }

You can modify this behavor with -update or -overwrite. Both options are
order dependant (i.e. not associative, A update B does
not necessarily equal B update A).

+ -update will add unique key/values from the second object to the first object
+ -overwrite replace key/values in first object one with second objects'

Running

    jsonjoin -create -update person.json profile.json

would yield

   { "name": "Doe, Jane", "email":"jd@example.org", "age": 42,
     "bio": "World renowned geophysist." }

Running

    jsonjoin -create -update profile.json person.json

would yield

   { "name": "Doe, Jane",  "age": 42,
     "bio": "World renowned geophysist.",
     "email": "jane.doe@example.edu" }

Running

    jsonjoin -create -overwrite person.json profile.json

would yield

   { "name": "Doe, Jane", "email":"jane.doe@example.edu", "age": 42,
     "bio": "World renowned geophysist." }
