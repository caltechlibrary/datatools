date from that specific date.

.SS RELATIVE WEEK DAYS
You can calculate a date from a weekday name (e.g.\ Saturday, Monday,
Tuesday) knowning a day (e.g.\ 2015\-02\-10 or the current date of the
week) occurring in a week.
A common case would be wanting to figure out the Monday date of a week
containing 2015\-02\-10.
The week is presumed to start on Sunday (i.e.\ 0) and finish with
Saturday (e.g.\ 6).
.IP
.EX
    reldate \-\-from=2015\-02\-10 Monday
.EE
.PP
will yield
.IP
.EX
    2015\-02\-09

As that is the Monday of the week containing 2015\-02\-10.
Weekday names case insensitive and can be the first three letters of the
English names or full English names (e.g.\ Monday, monday, Mon, mon).
