reldate handles dates in the YYYY-MM-DD format (e.g.\ March 1, 2014
would be 2014-03-01).

date from that specific date.

.SS RELATIVE WEEK DAYS
.PP
You can calculate a date from a weekday name (e.g.\ Saturday, Monday,
Tuesday) knowning a day (e.g.\ 2015-02-10 or the current date of the
week) occurring in a week.
A common case would be wanting to figure out the Monday date of a week
containing 2015-02-10.
The week is presumed to start on Sunday (i.e.\ 0) and finish with
Saturday (e.g.\ 6).
