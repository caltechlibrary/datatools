For strings
-----------

_datatools_ provides the [string](docs/string/) command for working with

cleanup data for analysis. The _string_ command was created for when the 
old Unix standbys- grep, awk, sed, tr are unwieldly or inconvient. 
_string_ provides operations are common in most language like, trimming, 
spliting, and transforming letter case.  The _string_ command also makes 
it easy to join JSON string arrays into single a string using a delimiter 
or split a string into a JSON array based on a delimiter. The form of the 
command is `string [OPTIONS] [ACTION] [ARCTION_PARAMETERS...]`

```shell
    string toupper "one two three"
```

Would yield "ONE TWO THREE".
